Nocturne Op 62 No 1 in B major. Frederic Chopin
(chopnnoct.mid)

This Nocturne was composed in 1846. It was dedicated to Mademoiselle
R de Konneritz. It has a beautiful song-like melody and rich harmony.
The melody is played in trills towards the end and sounds like people
chain ringing bells. It is very difficult technically, especially the
trills, but extremely attractive.
 
I sequenced this using a Yamaha Clavinova CLP-123, a Roland JV1080,
and an 386 PC running Midisoft's "Studio for Windows".
